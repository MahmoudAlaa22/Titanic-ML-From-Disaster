# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Overview

This project is based on the Titanic dataset, a classic in the field of data science and machine learning. The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on various features such as age, sex, passenger class, and more.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset, which can be found on Kaggle: [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).

### Features:

- **Survived**: 0 = No, 1 = Yes
- **Pclass**: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
- **Sex**: Sex
- **Age**: Age in years
- **SibSp**: # of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic
- **Parch**: # of parents / children aboard the Titanic
- **Ticket**: Ticket number
- **Fare**: Passenger fare
- **Cabin**: Cabin number
- **Embarked**: Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)


## Steps in the Notebook

1. **Data Exploration**: Initial exploration of the dataset to understand the distribution of features and relationships between them.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing data, converting categorical variables to numerical values, and feature engineering.
3. **Graphical Analysis:** We perform a graphical analysis to visualize the relationships between different features and survival status. This includes bar charts, histograms, and other visualizations to better understand the data.
4. **Model Building**: Implementing machine learning models to predict survival, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and more.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Comparing models based on accuracy and other performance metrics.


## Conclusion

This project demonstrates basic data exploration, data cleaning, and machine learning techniques applied to the Titanic dataset. It provides a foundation for understanding how to approach similar classification problems in the future.
